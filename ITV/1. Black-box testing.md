* black box testing is the idea of trying to make a program or a function fail, by giving it different inputs without knowing how any of the code works.

* some simple ways are just to generate random inputs and see if the program fails.
	* a reason for using random inputs rather than some you thought up yourself is that
		* it can generate automatic test cases
		* and also avoiding human biases (fx..)

	* one can also choose to fix the random seed
		* for the benefit that all the test cases are reproducible
		* but it means that the same test cases would be generated every time
	* unless if you choose randomly pick a seed and then write it to a file
		* because then it is possible to reproduce them
		* and each execution still uses different test inputs![[Pasted image 20240115154213.png]]

* boundary value tests
	* tries to hit the sweet spot between automatic and useful 
		* so by trying to hit (or over shoot) the boundaries we attempt to get some "reasonable" useful test cases and almost being automatic 
	* The reason for this is that errors tend to happen at the boundary values 
	* but what values should you check? ![[Pasted image 20240115160755.png]]
	* but to make it more robust we can also look at the exception handling by checking the values max+1 and min-1
		* this means that for *n* variables we have $4n+1$ (or 6n+1 for robust) test cases.
	* The problem here is that we dont look at the corner values (fx a,d) between all the different variables
		* if we do this then we end up with exponentially many cases: $5^n$ or $7^n$ ![[Pasted image 20240115163409.png]]

# come back to equivalence classes

* classes
* weak, strong and robust

* Decision tables ![[Pasted image 20240115171952.png]]
	* Decision table is a (partial) specification of programming behaviour
	* it is used for managing of complex decision logic 
	* ![[Pasted image 20240115173122.png]]
	* ![[Pasted image 20240115173134.png]]
	* decision table might have some redundant conditions (fx T T F is there twice)
		* but it can happen that if the same condition happens twice, but have different actions. 
		* which then makes the table inconsistent which makes it non-deterministic 
			* which is usually not desired 
	* A decision table is called complete if it covers all possible cases
		* have to cover each rule to get a complete test suite   

	* for test case generation 
		* then each rule is an equivalence class
		* apply test case gen (man / auto)
		* in general one can make 1 test case per row
			* but depends on "dont care" entries 
		* this might find all the faults 
			* but it is not for sure, since there might be sub-cases within the same rule 
			* and the implementation might differ ![[Pasted image 20240115174549.png]]
