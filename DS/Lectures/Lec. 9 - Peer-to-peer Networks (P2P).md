# Overlay Networks

* we exploit layered tree 
* dotted lines are the overlayed network(a, ..., e) on top of the psychical network beneath 
* jump between nodes to have less node connections 

* It adds a layer to the stack to provide something the underlying network does not have, without changing the underlying network:
	* A service (integrated into the network) e.g.: multimedia content distribution
	* A routing protocol e.g.: over ad-hoc network
	* Other e.g.: multicast integrated into the network, enhanced security
