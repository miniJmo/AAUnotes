# Turing Reduction

Say you know only addition and squaring, can you still multiply?

* We have reduced the problem of multiplication to that of addition and squaring.

This means that solving A cannot be more difficult than solving B. 

In the terms of computability theory:
* A reduces to B means that
	* if B is decidable then A is decidable too, and
	* if A is undecidable then B is undecidable too.

The way we will use reducibility:
* If we can reduce e.g. $A_T$$_M$ to some other problem (language) B, then B is undecidable.
