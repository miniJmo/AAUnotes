* np problems 

O(sqrt(n)) is bad xD

linear programming:
	Hilbert's tenth Problem


##### Complexity 
* We can prove that some problems... (N = NP)
* what is easy or hard?
	* I ran a marathon and it wasn't so hard for me... kinda stuff
	* current algorithms may go out of fashion or depend on the current hardware (missing something)
	* computability is about understanding some fundamental truth (missing something)


### Computability
* a problem can be made into a formal language

### Turing machines 
* What problems can be solved algorithmically (with a computer)
* how to define algorithm/computer?

* finite state automata 
	* can represent regular expressions like $a^*b$
* pushdown automata 
	* extends FSA with a stack
	* infite memory
	* represents context-free languages like $a^nb^n$


*”A Turing Machine can do everything that a real computer can do. Nevertheless, even a Turing Machine cannot solve certain problems”* (M. Sipser)

* decider = going to be a infinite loop or not (not sure if decider is loop or no loop)
	* to loop or not to loop #CsSheakspear 
	* ChatGPT: if it always return an definitive answer aka doesn't loop
