A language being *decidable*, does not mean that we can realistically solve it.
* It can require too much resources (time, memory).

*Complexity theory* aims to make a general conclusion about time and space requirements of decidable problems.

From now on we only consider *deciders and decidable languages.*

# Algorithm Complexity 
how do we measure time and memory?
* *Time* = number of computational **steps**
* *Memory* = the number of used **tape cells**

we will only focus on time and asymptotic worst-case behaviour of programs

## Runtime of a TM
*Definition*:
* Let $M$ be a deterministic decider. The *running time* or *worst-case time complexity* of $M$ is a function $$f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$$
* where $f(n)$ is the maximum number of steps that $M$ performs on any input of length $n$.

from now on $n$ always denotes the length of the input string.

### Big-O Notation 
Asymptotic upper bound *definition*:
* Let $f,g:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{>0}$ be functions. We write $f(n) = \mathcal{O}(g(n))$ iff
	* there are positive integers $c$ and $n_0$ such that
	* $f(n) \leq c \cdot g(n)$ for every $n \geq n_0$

**Strict** Asymptotic upper bound *definition*:
* Let $f,g:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{>0}$ be functions. We write $f(n) = \mathcal{O}(g(n))$ iff                 ![[Pasted image 20230816141415.png]]
* *Intuition*:
	* $f(n) =  \mathcal{O}(g(n))$ means ”asymptotically $f ≤ g$”
	* $f(n) = o(g(n))$ means ”asymptotically $f < g$”

# Complexity classes
Focus of *Algorithm Complexity*: 
* Study of **concrete algorithms** and the analysis of their precise complexity 

Focus of *Complexity Theory*: 
* Study of **problems (languages)** rather than concrete algorithms 
* Can we say for a given problem how easy/hard is it to solve?

Complexity Class *definition*:
* A complexity call is a *set of computational problems* of related resource-based complexity 

Complexity Class TIME *definition*:
* Let $t:\mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{>0}$ be a function.![[Pasted image 20230604154531.png]]

* *In other words*: TIME(t(n)) is the *class (collection) og languages* that are decidable by TMs running in time $\mathcal{O}(t(n))$.
* *Fact*: $TIME(n) \subset TIME(n^2) \subset \cdots \subseteq \cdots$![[Pasted image 20230604154820.png]]

**Theorem**:
* For any time constructible funciton $t: \mathcal{N} \rightarrow \mathcal{N}$, a language $A$ exists that is decidable in  $\mathcal{O}(t(n))$ time but not decidable in time $o(\frac{t(n)}{\log(n)})$.

*proof* sketch: 
* We construct a language that can be decided in O(t(n)) but that cannot be decided in time $o(\frac{t(n)}{\log(n)})$, by making sure it differs from all languages decidable in that time (using *diagonalization*). 
* →*Giving more time to a TM, means that we can solve more problems*

### Relationships between k-tapes and single-tape TMs
**Theorem**:
* Let $t(n)$ be a function s.t. $t(n) \geq n$.
* every $k$-tape TM running in time $t(n)$ has an equivalent single-tape TM running in time $\mathcal{O}(t^2(n))$
* *proof*:
	* Use the simulation of multi-tape TM $M$ by a single TM $M'$ (c.f. Chapter 8) and analyse the running time of $M'$.![[Pasted image 20230604160758.png]]


Church-Turing **Thesis**:
* Turing machines capture exactly the informal notion of algorithm

	* *But*, the presented simulation of a $k$-tape TM on a single-tape TM needs quadratically more time.
	* In fact, $k$-tape TMs cannot be simulated by single-tape TMs with the same time complexity.
	* The 1-tape TM is only *polynomially* slower than the $k$-tape TM.
	* If the multi-tape TM runs in polynomial time, the single-tape TM will also run in polynomial time.
	* Polynomial running time is defined by $\mathcal{O}(n^c)$ for some constant $c$

*Polynomial* Time Equivalence of Deterministic **Models**:
* All reasonable *deterministic models* of computation are polynomial time equivalent, i.e., they can simulate each other with only polynomial increase in the respective running times


# The Class P
Class P *definition*:
* The *class P* is the class of languages decidable in polynomial time on deterministic single-tape Turing machine, i.e.,
* ![[Pasted image 20230604161527.png]]

How to show that a language/problem $L_P$ is in P?
* Provide a TM M such that:
	* $L(M) = L_P$
	* $M$ is a polynomial time decider

example of language in P:

### encoding the input:
* When encoding numbers, we use a binary encoding (or any other encoding with base at least 2)but not the unary encoding.
	* example: ![[Pasted image 20230604163008.png]]![[Pasted image 20230604163824.png]]

## Other problems in P

## Closure Properties of P
**Theorem**:
* The class P is closed under intersection, union, complement, concatenation and Kleene start.

In other words:
* if $L_1$ and $L_2$ are decidable in deterministic polynomial time, then $L_1 \cap L_2$, $L_1 \cup L_2$, $\bar{L_1}$, $L_1.L_2$ and $L_1^*$ are decidable in  deterministic polynomial time too.

# The Class NP
P = NP?![[Pasted image 20230604165336.png]]

Running time of a nondeterministic TM *definition*:
* Let $M$ be a *nondeterministic* decider. The running time or time complexity of $M$ is a function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ where $f(n)$ is *the maximum number of steps that $M$ uses on any branch of its computation tree* for any input of length $n$.

time complexity class NTIME(t(n)) *definition*:
* Let $t: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{>0}$ be a function.![[Pasted image 20230604165949.png]]

*In other words*:
* NTIME(t(n)) is the class of languages that are decidable by *nondeterministic* TMs in time $\mathcal{O}(t(n))$.

The running time of $M$ is the *maximum number of steps* that $M$ uses on any branch of its computation tree for any input of length $n$![[Pasted image 20230604170658.png]]
* The running time of $M$ is the height of the computation tree (5 in the example)


The Class NP *Definition*:
* The **class NP** is the class of languages decidable in polynomial time on nondeterministic single-tape TM, i.e.,
* ![[Pasted image 20230604172038.png]]

example Hampath $\in$ NP
The NP class is *robust*

### Hamiltonian path example
![[Pasted image 20230604170818.png]]

Theorem:
* $HAMPATH \in NTIME(n^2)$

consider the following HAMPATH:![[Pasted image 20230604170948.png]]


# Polynomial Time Verifiable Languages
The class NP is the set of problems whose solutions can be verified in polynomial time.

This gives us an alternative way of showing that a problem belongs to the class NP:
* Assume that some solution, called *certificate* is given to us 
* Show that we can *verify* whether it is correct solution in *polynomial* time

polynomial time verifiable languages *definition*:
* A *verifier* for a language $L$ is a decider $V$ such that $L = \{w | V$ accepts $\langle w,c\rangle$ for some string $c\}$ 
* The string $c$ is called a *certificate* or a *proof*
* A verifier is called *polynomial time verifier* if it runs in a polynomial time in the length of $w$ (hence the length of $c$ is irrelevant).
* A language $L$ is *polynomial time verifiable language* if it has a polynomial time verifier.

example $HAMPATH$:
* *Certificate*: Path in $G$
* polynomial verifier algorithm: steps 2-5 of the decider 
* Hence HAMPATH has a polynomial time verifier.

**Theorem**:
* $HAMPATH \in NP$
	* consider the following TM verifier for HAMPATH:![[Pasted image 20230604174929.png]]
	* The *deterministic* decider runs in time $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$.


## Poly-Time verifiers vs. nondeterministic Poly-Time TMs  
**Theorem**:
* A language $L$ is polynomial time verifiable iff $L$ is decidable in polynomial time by a nondeterministic TM.

"$\Rightarrow$": Let V be a verifier for L running in time $\mathcal{O}(n^k)$. we construct a nondeterministic decider M for L:![[Pasted image 20230604175914.png]]
"$\Leftarrow$": Let M be a nondeterministic polynomial time decider for L. We construct a polynomial time verifier V for L:![[Pasted image 20230604180134.png]]

## co-NP
Observe, that $\bar{HAMPATH}$ is not necessarily in NP (in fact, we do not know if they are or not).

co-NP definition:
* $co-NP =^{def} \{\bar{L}|L\in NP\}$
	* *NP*: If the answer is yes, there is a proof of it that can be verified in polynomial time
	* *co-NP*: If the answer is no, there is a proof of it that can be verified in polynomial time

note: It is not known whether NP=co-NP. In fact if co-NP $\neq$ NP then P $\neq$ NP.


# P vs. NP
NP is in EXPTime
every problem in NP can be solved in exponential time on a deterministic TM.
**Theorem**:
* Let $t(n)$ be a function s.t. $t(n) \geq n$.
* Every nondeterministic TM running in time $t(n)$ has an equivalent deterministic TM running in time $2^{O(t(n))}$

*Proof*:
* Simulate a nondeterministic TM $M$ by a deterministic TM $M'$ (chapter 8) and analyse the running time of $M'$.
![[Pasted image 20230604192418.png]]
*Remark*: 
* $P \subseteq NP \subseteq EXPTIME$ and $P \subseteq co-NP \subseteq EXPTIME$ 
* We know that $P \neq EXPTIME$, but
* the strictness of the other inclusions, as well as the question whether $NP = co-NP$, are still open

# Polynomial Time Reducibility 
Polynomial Time Computable Function *Definition*:
* A function $f: \Sigma \rightarrow \Sigma^*$ is a *polynomial time computable function* iff there exists a TM $M_f$ *running in polynomial time* which on any given input $w \in \Sigma^*$ 
	* Always halts, and
	* leaves just $f(w)$ on its tape.

Polynomial Time Mapping Reducibility *definition*:
* Let $A,B \subseteq \Sigma^*$. We say that language $A$ is *polynomial time (mapping) reducible* to language B, written $A\leq_P B$, iff
	1. there is a *polynomial time computable function* $f:\Sigma^* \rightarrow \Sigma^*$ such that
	2. for every $w \in \Sigma^*$: $w \in A$ iff $f(w)\in B$

**Theorem**:
* If $A\leq_P B$ and $B\in P$, then $A\in P$.

*proof*:
* Let $f$ be a polynomial time reduction from $A$ to $B$ computed by a machine $M_f$ running in time $\mathcal{O}(n^k)$
* Let $M_B$ be a decider for $B$ running in time $\mathcal{O}(n^l)$

We construct a polynomial time decider $M_A$ for $A$:![[Pasted image 20230604194005.png]]

## SAT Problem
* Let $V = \{x_1,x_2,\cdots,y,z,\cdots\}$ be a set of boolean variables.

Boolean formulae *definition*:
* The set of *Boolean formulae* is defined by the abstract syntax:
	* $\phi::= x|\phi_1\wedge \phi_2|\phi_1\vee\phi_2|\neg\phi$ 
* where $x$ ranges of the set of variables.

A Boolean formula $\phi$ is *satisfable* if there is an assignment of truth values to the variable on which $\phi$ evaluates to true.

SAT *definition*:
![[Pasted image 20230604200152.png]]

3SAT problem:
* *Literal* is a variable or a negation of a variable.
* Instead of $\neg x$ we usually write $\bar{x}$.
* *Clause* of size 3 is a disjunction of three literals.
* A formula in *3-CNF*(3 Conjunctive Normal Form) is a conjunction of clauses of size 3.![[Pasted image 20230604200815.png]]

The certificate is a satisfying assignment: $x_1 = T, x_2 = T, x_3 =T$.
The language 3SAT *definition*:![[Pasted image 20230604201004.png]]

**Theorem**:
* $3SAT \geq_P CLIQUE$
*Proof*: For a $3SAT$ instance with k clauses
![[Pasted image 20230604202806.png]]
construct in *poly-time* an instance $G = (V,E),k$ of $CLIQUE$ s.t.
formula $\phi$ is satisfiable if and only if $G$ has a $k$-clique.

$V$ ... every occurrence of a literal in $\phi$ is a node (3k nodes)
$E$ ... all possible connections, without
* edges between literals in the same clause, and without
* edges between contradictory literals ($x$ and $\bar{x}$)



# NP-Complete
HP-hardness *definition*:
* A language B is *NP-hard* iff for every $A\in NP$ we have $A\leq_P B$.
	* B is as hard as all other problems in NP (and possibly harder)
	* *Remark*: B is not necessarily an NP problem (NP-hard $\nsubseteq$ NP)

NP-Completeness *definition*:
* A language B is *NP-complete* iff
	1. $B \in NP$ (*containment in NP*), and
	2. for every $A \in NP$ we have $A\leq_P B$(*NP-hardness*)

**Theorem**:
* If B is NP-complete and $B \in P$, then P = NP
*proof*: We know that  $A\leq_P B$ and $B \in P$ then $A \in P$

**Theorem**:
* If B is NP-complete,  $B\leq_P C$, and $C \in NP$, then C is NP-complete
*proof*: because $\leq_P$ is transitive ![[Pasted image 20230604205849.png]]

Consequence:
* If just one NP-complete problem can be solved in P then all other problems in NP will be solvable in P (hence P=NP). 
* If P $\neq$ NP then none of the NP-complete problems is solvable in deterministic polynomial time.


# Cook-Levin Theorem
The Cook-Levin **Theorem**:
* The language SAT is NP-complete.

* *proof*: SAT is clearly in NP. We have to show that SAT is NP-hard:
	* Every language $A\in NP$ is poly-time reducible to SAT
		* Let us assume any given $A \in NP$, so
		* there is a nondeterm. decider M for A running in time O($n^k$).
	* our aim: For any input string w construct in polynomial time a boolean formula $\phi$ such that
		* *M accepts w iff $\phi$ is satisfiable.*
	
## Boolean formula Describing Table of configurations
![[Pasted image 20230604211056.png]]

* Assume a table of configuration when M is run on $w = w_1\dots w_n$. We will construct a formula $\phi$ such that M accepts $w$ iff $\phi \in SAT$.

The set of variables contains: $x_{i,j,s}$
Where $1\leq i,j\leq n^k$ and $s \in C$ is a tape symbol or a control state.
Note: There are only polynomial many variables w.r.t. to n.

*Intuition*:
* Variable $x_{i,j,s}$ is true iff cell\[$i,j$\] contain the symbol s.

# Other NP-Complete Problems
To *show that a problem B is NP-complete* we show that:
1. B is in NP 
	* By providing a nondeterministic TM that decides B in polynomial time **or**
	* By providing a TM that validates some certificate solution c for B in polynomial time.
2. B is NP-hard
	* By choosing $A \in NP$-hard and showing $A \leq_P B$.
	* (A should actually be NP-complete because otherwise the reduction is not possible if B is in NP)

**Theorem**:
* If A is NP-complete, $A \leq_P B$, and $B \in NP$, then B is NP-complete.

list of all NP-complete problems in slides: 3SAT, Clique, vetex-cover, Hampath
look at them if needed.

On the importance of NP-complete problems
* it is a good idea to take a look at the list of NP-complete problems and familiarise yourself with a few of them
	* if you need to solve a similar problem, it may give you a hint that your problem is hard
	* if you want to prove that a problem is NP-hard, you can use any of the them for the reduction
	* Knowing the name of a problem can help you to find good algorithms for it
