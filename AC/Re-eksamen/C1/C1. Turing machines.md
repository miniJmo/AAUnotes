**The purpose of Turing machines:**
* can every problem be solved (efficiently) by an algorithm?
* actually what is an algorithm? And what is a problem? And what does efficiently mean?
* Can an algorithm solving A help me solving problem B?
* Is it harder to compute something than to verify something?

# Motivation
What to do when you can't find an efficient algorithm?
* **Computability**: We can prove that some problems cannot be solved by computers
* **Complexity**: We can prove that some problems cannot be solved in polynomial time by computers (unless P=NP)

Computability/complexity is about understanding some *fundamental truth* about the (computational) limitations of our universe!

# Languages
In theoretical parts of this course, we are mostly concerned with *decision problems*

Decision problems:
* A decision problem is a yes/no question on an (typically infinit) set of inputs
	* example: Given $p \in \mathbb{N}$, is $p$ prime?

Formal languages (*repetition*): 
* Let $\Sigma$ be a finite, nonempty set called *alphabet*
* A *string* or *word* $w$ over $\Sigma$ is a finite sequence of symbols from $\Sigma$.
* An *empty string* is denoted $\epsilon$. 
* A *concatenation* of strings $w_1$ and $w_2$ is a string $w_1w_2$.
* A *length* of a string $w$ is the number of symbols in $w$ and it is denoted by $|w|$.
* The set of all strings over $\Sigma$ is denoted by $\Sigma^*$.
* A *Language* $L$ over $\Sigma$ is any subset of $\Sigma^*$, i.e., $L\subseteq \Sigma^*$.

*Operations* on languages:![[Pasted image 20230603184700.png]]

### decision problems as languages.
We can express decision problems as questions about languages:
* Example: 
	* Given $p \in \mathbb{N}$, is $p$ prime?
	* Let $L_{primes}$ be a language of the prime numbers: 
		* $L_{primes} = \{w \in \{0,...,9\}*| w$ is prime$\}$

# Turing Machines

* What problems can be solved *algorithmically (with a computer)*?
	First we need to use a simpler mathematical construction 
	* Aka **Pushdown automata** (PDA)
		* It extends a **FSA**(finte state automata) with a stack
		* has infinite memory but can only access it in a *limited way*
		* PDA represent context free languages 

### Computations 
* Computations of a Turing machine can be done with input/output tapes
* We essentially have a pen, an eraser, finitely many symbols we can write, and as many sheets of paper as we need![[Pasted image 20230603192430.png]]
	
* Basically a finite-state automaton with *unbounded memory*
* Program ends with $q_{accept}$ or $q_{reject}$.

* Turing Machines defines the **limits** of computation
### Definition:
* A *Turing machine* is a 7-tuple $M = (Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,q_{accept},q_{reject})$:
	* Q is a finite set of *states*
	* $\Sigma$ is a finite *input alphabet* ($\sqcup \notin \Sigma$ )
	* $\Gamma$ is a finite *tape alphabet* ($\sqcup$ = empty/blank symbol, $\sqcup \in \Gamma$ and $\Sigma \subset \Gamma$)
	* $\delta$: $Q\times \Gamma \rightarrow Q\times \Gamma \times \{L,R\}$ is the *transition function*,
	* $q_0 \in Q$ is the start state
	* $q_{accept} \in Q$ is the accept state, and
	* $q_{reject} \in Q$ is the reject state, where $q_{accept} \neq q_{reject}$ ![[Pasted image 20230603193646.png]]

	* example of a transition function:![[Pasted image 20230603194005.png]]

### Configuration
Let **M** be a TM.
informally, a configuration consists of 
* the current control-state
* the current control tape content, and
* the current head position.

formal definition:
A **configuration** of a TM is a *string* $uqv$ where
* $u \in \Gamma^*$ is the initial part of the tape,
* $q\in Q$ is the current state,
* $v \in \Gamma^*$ is the final part of the tape and the head points at the first symbol of $v$.

**acceptance** of a string by a Turing machine![[Pasted image 20230603195410.png]]

* **Decider**:
	Assume that a TM **M** computes from the initial configuration $C_1 = q_0w$ (note that this computation is *deterministic*)
	* there are three possible outcomes of *running **M** on w*:
		* C1, C2, . . . , Ck ends in *accept* configuration Ck, or
		* C1, C2, . . . , Ck ends in *reject* configuration Ck, or
		* C1, C2, . . . does *not terminate* (loops).

	* formal *definition*:
		* A TM **M** which for *any input string w always halts* (either in accept or reject configuration) is called a **decider**.

# Recognisable and Decidable languages
* What problems can be solved algorithmically?
	* what do we mean when we say that an algorithm soles a problem?

*Language **definition***:
* The *language recognised by a TM **M***, or simply the *language of **M*** is:       $L(M) = \{w\in \Sigma^* | M$ accepts $w\}$ 

*recognisable language **definition***:
* A language $L\subseteq \Sigma^*$ is *recognisable* if there exists a TM M such that M recognises L, i.e., $L =L(M)$

*Decidable language **definition***:
* A Language $L\subseteq \Sigma^*$ is **decidable** if there exists a TM M such that *M is a decider* and M recognises L,i.e., $L=L(M)$![[Pasted image 20230603201652.png]]

Computational function:
* Idea: Turing machines can also compute functions $f:\Sigma^* ->\Sigma^*$.

*computational function* **definition**:
* A function $f:\Sigma^* \rightarrow \Sigma^*$ is a *computational function* iff (if and only if) there exists a TM $M_f$ which on any given input $w \in \Sigma^*$
	* always halts, and
	* leaves just $f(w)$ on its tape.![[Pasted image 20230603202201.png]]





# Church-Turing Thesis
Is a Turing Machine everything we can do? What about... 
* parallel computing? 
* quantum computing? 
* neural networks/machine learning?
* some weird technology that we havenâ€™t invented yet? 

*Robustness* **definition**:
* A model of computation is *robust* if no *reasonable* extension increases its power.
* (Turing machines are very robust)


Alonzo church invented $\lambda$-calculus and Turing machines were shown equivalent.

Church-Turing Thesis:
* **Algorithms** (informal notion) **=** **Turing machines** (formal, mathematical, concept)

this thesis cannot be proved, but nothing more powerful than a TM has been found so far.

*Turing-complete*:
* A model of computation is *Turing-complete* if it can simulate a TM -> can do everything that a TM can do

# Multitape TM
Multitape Turing machine **definition**: 
* A *$k$-tape TM* is a 7-tuple $M = (Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,q_{accept},q_{reject})$ where
	* $\delta$: $Q\times \Gamma^k \rightarrow Q\times \Gamma^k \times \{L,R\}^k$ 
	and the rest is the same as before.

remark: 1-tape TM is exactly our original definition of TM.

* *Configuration*: 
	* a control state, plus the content af all $k$ tapes together with the position of $k$ heads.
* *Initial configuration*: 
	* input string written on the first tape, all other tapes are empty (contain the blank symbol s($\sqcup$))
* *Computational step*: 
	* all heads can move independently.

## Equivalence of 1-tape and $k$-tape TM
**Theorem**:
* Every $k$-tape TM is equivalent to 1-tape TM.
	Corollaries:
	* A language is recognisable iff it is recognised by some multitape Turing machine
	* A language is decidable iff it is recognised by some multitape Turing machine which is a decider.

* Let $M_k = (Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,q_{accept},q_{reject})$ be a $k$-tape TM.
* we construct a TM $M = (Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,q_{accept},q_{reject})$ such that it simulates $M_k$
	* For each configuration $C^k_i$ of $M_k$ there exists an equivalent configuration of $\mathcal{M}, C_i$
	* For each transition $C^k_i \rightarrow C^k_{i+1}$ in $M_k$ we have a sequence $C_i \rightarrow \cdots \rightarrow C_{i+1}$ 
* We are free to choose $Q,\Sigma,\Gamma$ and $\delta$

* **To see an example of this look from slide 100 (21) in slides for this lecture**

# Nondeterministic TM
nondeterministic Turing machine **definition**:
* A *nondeterministic TM* is a 7-tuple $M = (Q,\Sigma,\Gamma,\delta,q_0,q_{accept},q_{reject})$ where
	* $\delta$: $Q\times \Gamma \rightarrow 2^{Q\times \Gamma \times \{L,R\}}$ 
* and the rest is the same as before.

Remark: Every deterministic TM is also a nondeterministic TM.
* *configuration* and *initial configuration* is the same as before

#### example:![[Pasted image 20230603215255.png]]
* *Computation tree*: a tree of alle the configurations reachable from the initial one. The tree can have infinite branches.

## Acceptance Condition
Acceptance condition of a Nondeterministic TM:
* A nondeterministic TM $\mathcal{M}$ accepts a string $w$ if the computation tree for $\mathcal{M}$ and $w$ contains *at least one accepting configuration*.

* A nondeterministic TM is a decider if for any given input every branch in the computation tree is finite (accepts or rejects).

## Equivalence of Non- and Deterministic TM
*Theorem*:
* Every nondeterministic Turing machine can be simulated by a (deterministic) 3-tape Turing machine (and therefore by a standard Turing machine)

Deterministic 3-tape TM $\mathcal{M}_3$ simulates nondeterministic TM $\mathcal{M}'$:
* for every configuration of $\mathcal{M}$' there is a configuration of $\mathcal{M}_3$.
* every configuration in the computation tree of $\mathcal{M}'$ and $w$ is reached by the unique run of $\mathcal{M}_3$ on $w$ (but possibly more auxiliary configurations as well).
* $\mathcal{M}_3$ accepts if and only if accepting configuration of $\mathcal{M}'$ is reached.
* $\mathcal{M}_3$ rejects if and only if computation tree is finite and no accepting configuration of $\mathcal{M}'$ is reached.

*Corollary*:
* A language is *recognisable* iff it is the language of some nondeterministic **Turing machine**
* A language is *decidable* iff it it the language of some nondeterministic **decider**.


# Decidability 
* how do algorithmic problems correspond to languages?
	* *Algorithmically solvable* problems $\equiv$ *decidable* languages.

A problem is solvable if its language is decidable. How do we show that a language is decidable?
* Specify a TM $M$ that recognises $L$ (or a $k$-tape TM; or a nondeterministic TM)
* Show that $M$ is a decider (halts on every input)

*Theorem*: 
* The Class of decidable languages is closed under intersection, union, complement, concatenation and Kleene star.

* what does closed under mean?
	* if $L_1$ and $L_2$ are decidable languages then $L_1 \cap L_2$, $L_1 \cup L_2$, $\bar{L_1}$, $L_1.L_2$ and $L_1^*$ are decidable too.![[Pasted image 20230604094638.png]]

*Theorem*:
* The Class of recognisable languages is closed under intersection, union, concatenation and Kleene star.
	* BUT **not** under complement 
	* proof:![[Pasted image 20230814203517.png]]




* Diagonalisation 
	* There are some languages that are not recognisable (and therefore not decidable).
		* can we show that are more languages than TMs?
		* we can show this by diagonalisation!
			* first of will have to prove the set of all TMs are countable
				* We can do a list of all possible TMs. 
				* Consider that you can map each TM to a natural number by (1) represent each TM as a string that describes its alphabet and transition function; 
				* (2) transform such a string to binary; 
				* (3) interpret the binary string as a number. 
				* *(Intuition: This is possible for TMs and not real numbers because each TM has a finite description.).*
			* then we need to show that the set of all languages are uncountable
				* here we use diagonalisation!!
					* Diagonalisation on $w_i \in L_j$ for languages $L_j$ and words $w_i$ ![[Pasted image 20230604110013.png]]
					* *corollary*: There are some languages that are not recognisable
