# Universal Turing machines (UTM)
The problems from Formal language theory:
**Decision Problems**:
* *Acceptance*: Does a given string belong to a given language
* *Emptiness*: Is a given language empty?
* *Equality*: Are given two languages equal?

These problems only makes sense how the different languages are described 

|     | Acceptance | Emptiness | Equality |
|-----|------------|-----------|----------|
| DFA | ?          | ?         | ?        |
| NFA | ?          | ?         | ?        |
| CFG | ?          | ?         | ?        |
| TM  | ?          | ?         | ?        |

Universal Turing Machine:
* Is a TM capable of *computing* any computable *sequence* 

* Given a TM $\langle M \rangle$ and a string $w$, does $M$ accept $w$?![[Pasted image 20230604101507.png]]


# Diagonalisation
* *Claim*: There are some languages that are not recognisable (and therefore not decidable).
	* *proof*:
		* Each TM M has exactly one language L(M)
		* so let's count
			* how many TMs are there? $\infty$
			* how many languages are there? $\infty$
		* dead end?

**no** since different sets can have the same size even though they dont have the same symbols

You can either *compare* sets by **counting** (does not work with $\infty$ elements) or more interesting with **bijection**  
## Bijection
what about $\mathbb{Z}$ vs $\mathbb{N}$? (integers vs natural numbers)
* well one can count, but...
* can also use Bijection:
	* Two sets are of the the same size iff there is a bijection between them
	* *Definition*:
		* A function $f: A \rightarrow B$ is called *bijection* (correspondence) iff
			* $f$ is *injective* (one-to-one), $f(a) \neq f(b)$ whenever $a\neq b$, and
			* $f$ is *surjective* (onto), for every $b \in B$ there is $a\in A$ such that $f(a)=b$.

### Bijection example
![[Pasted image 20230604103315.png]]
*Note*: the naive way of thinking of mapping each natural number to itself does not work because then negative numbers are not mapped to any natural number.![[Pasted image 20230604103438.png]]

rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$:

## Countable sets
*definition*:
* A set $A$ is *countable* if it is either finite or there is a bijection between the set $A$ and the set of natural numbers.

facts: 
* all even natural numbers are countable 
* The set of integer numbers are countable 
* The set of rational numbers are countable 

**Theorem**: 
* The set of real numbers are countable 
* *proof*: by contradiction via the diagonalisation method.![[Pasted image 20230604104231.png]]

## Diagonalisation 
![[Pasted image 20230604104507.png]]

**Theorem**:
* The set of all TMs is countable.
* *proof* sketch: 
	* We can do a list of all possible TMs. 
	* Consider that you can map each TM to a natural number by (1) represent each TM as a string that describes its alphabet and transition function; 
	* (2) transform such a string to binary; 
	* (3) interpret the binary string as a number. 
	* *(Intuition: This is possible for TMs and not real numbers because each TM has a finite description.).*

**Theorem**: 
* The set of languages is uncountable.
* *proof* sketch:
	* Diagonalisation on $w_i \in L_j$ for languages $L_j$ and words $w_i$ ![[Pasted image 20230604110013.png]]
* *corollary*: There are some languages that are not recognisable 


# Decidable Problems
Decision problems make sense only if we specify how the given languages are described (they must have a finite description e.g. via finite automata, cfg or TMs).

|     | Acceptance | Emptiness | Equality |
|-----|------------|-----------|----------|
| DFA | **yes**          | ?         | ?        |
| NFA | ?          | ?         | ?        |
| CFG | ?          | ?         | ?        |
| TM  | ?          | ?         | ?        |

## acceptance
problem: Given a DFA B and a string w, does B accept w?![[Pasted image 20230815164606.png]]

**Theorem**:
* The language $A_{DFA}$ is decidable.
* *proof*: 
	* Construct a decider $M$ for $A_{DFA}$:
	* M = On input $x$:
		1. Check if $x$ is of the form $\langle B,w \rangle$ where $B$ is a DFA and $w$ is a string, if not then $M$ *rejects*.
		2. Simulate $B$ on $w$ (states of $B$ are stored on the tape).
		3. If the simulation accepted then $M$ *accepts*. If it rejected then $M$ *rejects*.

*problem*: Given a NFA $B$ and string $w$, does $B$ accept $w$?![[Pasted image 20230815165101.png]]

* **Theorem**:
	* The language $A_{NFA}$ is a decidable
	* *proof*:
	* Construct a decider $M$ for $A_{DFA}$:
	* M = On input $x$:
		1. Check if $x$ is of the form $\langle B,w \rangle$ where $B$ is an NFA and $w$ is a string, if not then $M$ *rejects*.
		2. Convert $B$ to an equivalent DFA $B'$.
		3. Run the algorithm for $A_{DFA}$ on $B'$ and $w$.

# An Undecidable Problem
acceptance *problem* for a Turing machine: 
* Given a TM M and a string w, does M accept w?
![[Pasted image 20230604111420.png]]
**Theorem**:
* The language $A_{TM}$ is undecidable 
* The language $A_{TM}$ is recognisable 
*proof* of recognisable:
* construct a recogniser U for $A_{TM}$
	* U = ”On input ⟨M, w⟩:
	* 1. simulate M on w.
	* 2. if M accepted then U accepts (same for reject)

*Remark*: The machine U (also called the *universal TM*) is not a decider (if M runs into an infinite loop on input w, then U runs into an infinite loop on input ⟨M, w⟩).

*proof* of Undecidability:
* By contradiction assume that there is a *decider* $H$ for $A_{TM}$:![[Pasted image 20230604112352.png]]
* From $H$ we can build a machine $D$, which is also a *decider*:![[Pasted image 20230604112427.png]]
* What happens if we run $D$ on $\langle D \rangle$?
	1. D *accepts* ⟨D⟩, but then H *rejected* ⟨D,⟨D⟩⟩ and hence D did not accept ⟨D⟩, contradiction!
	2. D *rejects* ⟨D⟩, but then H *accepted* ⟨D,⟨D⟩⟩ and hence D accepted ⟨D⟩, contradiction! 
* So D cannot *exist*, so H cannot *exist* either 
* Which means that $A_{TM}$ is *undecidable*. (but Turing recognisable)

*Diagonalisation* and $A_{TM}$![[Pasted image 20230604112819.png]]


# Co-recognisable Languages
Intuition for a *recognisable* language L (recognised by TM M):
* If $w \in L$ then M run on w will *halt in accept state*
* If $w \notin L$ then M run on w will *reject or loop*.

Intuition for a *co-recognisable* language L (recognised by TM M):
* If $w \notin L$ then M run on w will *halt in accept state*
* If $w \in L$ then M run on w will *reject or loop*.

* *Definition*:
	* A language $L$ is *co-recognisable* if $\bar{L}$ is *recognisable*.![[Pasted image 20230604115104.png]]

**Theorem**:
*  A language is *decidable* iff it is recognisable and co-recognisable ![[Pasted image 20230604114841.png]]



# Reduction 
Wouldn’t it be great if we could show that $L$ is undecidable by providing a TM? 
* **Reduction** to the rescue!

*intuition*:
* Say you know only addition and squaring, can you still multiply?
$$x\cdot y = \frac{(x+y)^2-x^2-y^2}{2}$$
* We have *reduced* the problem of multiplication to that of addition and squaring
* On the other hand, squaring is a special case of multiplication
* So, in some sense both multiplication and squaring have the same complexity

Informal *definition*:
* A problem $A$ *is reducible to problem* $B$ iff the solution to problem $B$ can be used to solve the problem $A$.
	* this means that solving A cannot be more difficult than solving B.

A reduced to B means that:
* if B is *decidable* then A is decidable too, and
* if A is *undecidable* then B is undecidable too.

The way we will use reducibility:
* If we can reduce e.g. $A_{TM}$ to some other problem (language) B, then B is undecidable.

*proof* structure to show undecideability:
* proof by contradiction:
	* We want to show that a language $B$ is undecidable using the fact that we already know that the language $A$ is undecidable
		1. Assume for a while that we have a decider $M_B$ for the language $B$ 
		2. Using $M_B$ we conduct a decider $M_A$ for the language $A$
		3. Because we know that $M_A$ cannot exist ($A$ is undecidable), this implies that $M_B$ cannot exist either.
		4. Conclusion is that the language $B$ is undecidable
* In the *proof* we provided a reduction from an undecidable language $A$ to the language $B$. Hence $B$ is undecidable too.

### The language $HALT_{TM}$
*Problem*: ”Given a TM M and a string w, does M halt on w?"![[Pasted image 20230604121403.png]]

* **theorem**: 
	* the language $HALT_{TM}$ is undecidable 
	* *proof*: We reduce $A_{TM}$ to $HALT_{TM}$.![[Pasted image 20230815193256.png]]
	1. By contradiction. Assume there is a decider $R$ for $HALT_{TM}$
	2. Using the decider $R$, we construct a decider $S$ for $A_{TM}$:![[Pasted image 20230815193312.png]]
	3. So $S$ is a decider for $A_{TM}$, but we know that $S$ does not exist.
	4. Conclusion: the decider $R$ does not exist either and so $HALT_{TM}$ is undecidable.

### Empty language $E_{TM}$
what about an empty language?
*Problem*: "Given a TM $M$ is the language of $M$ empty?"![[Pasted image 20230604122955.png]]

* **Theorem**: 
	* The language $E_{TM}$ is undecidable.
	* *proof*: We reduce $A_{TM}$ to $E_{TM}$ ![[Pasted image 20230815194114.png]]
		1. By contradiction. Assume there is a decider $R$ for $E_{TM}$
		2. Using the decider $R$, we construct a decider $S$ for $A_{TM}$:![[Pasted image 20230815194103.png]]
		3. So $S$ is a decider for $A_{TM}$ , but we know that $S$ does not exist
		4. Conclusion: $R$ cannot exist and hence $E_{TM}$ is undecidable



Rice's **Theorem**:
* Every language P which is a nontrivial property of Turing machine languages is undecidable.

# Mapping Reduction
#### proof template to show undecidabileity by reduction:
* We know that language A is undecidable. By reducing A to B we want to show that the language B too.
	1. By contradiction assume that we have a decider $M_B$ for $B$
	2. Using $M_B$ we construct a decider $M_A$ for the language $A$![[Pasted image 20230604124442.png]]
	3. We know that $M_A$ cannot exist, so $M_B$ cannot exist either.
	4. Conclusion: The language $B$ is undecidable 

## Computable Function
*Idea*: Turing machine can also compute functions $f: \Sigma^* \rightarrow \Sigma^*$.

*Definition*:
* A function $f: \Sigma^* \rightarrow \Sigma^*$ is a *computable function* iff there exists an TM $M_f$ which on any given input $w \in \Sigma^*$ 
	* always halts, and
	* leaves just $f(w)$ on its tape.

### example

## Mapping 
*Definition*:
* Let $A, B \subset \Sigma^*$. We say that language A is *mapping reducible* to language B, written $A\leq_m B$, iff
	1. There is a computable function $f: \Sigma^* \rightarrow \Sigma^*$ such that 
	2. for every $w \in \Sigma^*$:
		* $w \in A$ iff $f(w) \in B$
		* or equivalently: if $w \in A$ then $f(w) \in B$, and if $w \notin A$ then $f(w) \notin B$.![[Pasted image 20230604130656.png]]
		* $f$ does not need to be invertible or bijective ($A\leq_m B \neq B\leq_m A$) 
		* this is called *many to one reducibility* 

* example: ![[Pasted image 20230604132737.png]]

* Results of mapping reducibility:
* main **Theorem**:
	* Assume that $A \leq_m B$. Then: 
		* If B is decidable then A is decidable. 
		* If A is undecidable then B is undecidable. 
		* If B is recognizable then A is recognizable. 
		* If A is not recognizable then B is not recognizable.
		* $\bar{A}\leq_m\bar{B}$


* *Turing Reducibility* ($A\leq_TB$): given an “oracle” for B, construct a TM for A 
	* →Useful to show that B is *undecidable*
* *Mapping Reducibility* ($A\leq_mB$): map input from A to input from B 
	* →Useful to show that B is *undecidable* or *unrecognizable*

**theorem**: If $A\leq_mB$ then $A\leq_TB$


# Beyond Recognisable Problems
The $EQ_{TM}$ problem:![[Pasted image 20230604143806.png]]

**Theorem**: 
* The language $EQ_{TM}$ is neither recognisable nor co-recognisable 
*proof*:
* We show that 
	* $\bar{A_{TM}} \leq_m EQ_{TM}$, and ![[Pasted image 20230604144102.png]]
	* $\bar{A_{TM}} \leq_m \bar{EQ_{TM}}$.![[Pasted image 20230604144136.png]]

# Post Correspondence Problem (PCP)
A PCP instance over $\Sigma$ is a finite collection P of dominos$$P = \{[\frac{t_1}{b_1}], [\frac{t_2}{b_2}],\cdots,[\frac{t_k}{b_k}]\}$$
Where for all $i, 1 \leq i \leq k,t_i,b_i \in \Sigma^*$
![[Pasted image 20230604145007.png]]

![[Pasted image 20230604145337.png]]

* **Theorem**:
	* The language $PCP$ is undecidable.
	* *proof*:
		* By reduction via computation histories from $A_{TM}$
		* **Definition** Let $M$ be a TM. A *computation history* of $M$ on input $w$ is a sequence of configurations $C_1, C_2, . . . , C_ℓ$ such that:
			* $C_1 = q_0w$ is the initial configuraiton
			* $C_i$ yields $C_{i+1}$ for all $1 \leq i < ℓ$, and
			* $C_ℓ$ is a halting configuration (in either accept or reject state)
		* If $C_ℓ$ is accepting, then the history is called *accepting*
		* If $C_ℓ$ is rejecting, then the history is called *rejecting*


Take away from *PCP*: 
* *Not all* undecidable problems have something directly to do with TMs or other models of computation!
* Mapping reduction is *not always* between TM descriptions and can be creative
* PCP is also useful to apply reduction
