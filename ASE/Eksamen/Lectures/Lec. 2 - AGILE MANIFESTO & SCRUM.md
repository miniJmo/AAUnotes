# Minifesto for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
* **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
* **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
* **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
* **Responding to change** over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.


# Scrum
* Udtrykket kommer fra rugby
* "en lille gruppe er ansvarlige for at samle bolden op og få den tættere på målet"

## Scrum core concepts
* **Det er alt sammen omkring respekt, engagement, empowerment og at tage ansvar**

* splittet op i two bekymringer 
	* I hvilken rækkefølge skal tingene gøres i (PO)
	* Hvor meget arbejde vil vi tage på os (Team)

* Kulturen er åben og ærlig kommunikation 
	* team player over individet 

* Inspicere og tilpas
	* mere fokus på målet/resultater end at præcis estimation eller den originale plan![[Pasted image 20240107174512.png]]

## Scrum kører i to spor
* success afhænger af en balance mellem de to spor ![[Pasted image 20240107175153.png]]
* When READY is well implemented a positive spiral emerge.
* When READY is ill implemented a negative spiral is started

## Scrum roller 
### Product Owner 
* **Personen der tager beslutningerne: rækkefølgen og indholdet af product backloggen**
	* acceptere eller afviser arbejdsresultater 
	* har ansvar for "visionen og profitability" af produktet 
	* Definere hvilke features af produktet. 
	* Beslutter release dates og indholdet - *release planning*
* aktiviteter![[Pasted image 20240108144347.png]]
### Scrum Master
* **Facilitator af Scrum processen**
	* sikre at Scrum processen bliver overholdt og fulgt 
	* muliggøre tæt samarbejde imellem alle roller og funktioner
	* fjerner barriere 
	* skærmer Teamet fra eksterne forstyrrelser
	* *Ikke* en project manager 
* aktiviteter ![[Pasted image 20240108144403.png]]
### Team
* **Professionelle der ejer deres egen Sprint plan**
	* krydsfunktionelle, 7 (+-2) medlemmer 
	* vælger sprint goalet og specifikke arbejdsresultater 
	* har rettigheden til at gøre alt indenfor rammerne af projekt guidlines for at nå iterations målet 
	* orginisere sigselv samt arbejdet 
	* demonstrere arbejdsresultater til Product Owner 
* aktiviteter ![[Pasted image 20240108144431.png]]

## Scrum
| Koncept | Definitnation |
| ---- | ---- |
| Development team | A self-organising group of software developers, which should be 7 +/-2 people. They are responsible for developing the software and other essential project documents. |
| Potentially shippable product increment | The software increment that is delivered from a sprint. The idea is that this should be ‘potentially shippable’ which means that it is in a finished state and no further work, such as testing, is needed to incorporate it into the final product. In practice, this is not always achievable. |
| Product backlog | This is a list of ‘to do’ items which the Scrum team must tackle. They may be feature definitions for the software, software requirements, user stories or descriptions of supplementary tasks that are needed, such as architecture definition or user documentation. |
| Product Owner | An individual (or possibly a small group) whose job is to identify product features or requirements, prioritize these for development and continuously review the product backlog to ensure that the project continues to meet critical business needs. The Product Owner can be a customer but might also be a product manager in a software company or other stakeholder representative. |
| Daily Scrum | A daily meeting of the Scrum team that reviews progress and prioritizes work to be done that day. Ideally, this should be a short face-to-face meeting that includes the whole team. |
| Scrum Master | The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum process is followed and guides the team in the effective use of Scrum. He or she is responsible for interfacing with the rest of the company and for ensuring that the Scrum team is not diverted by outside interference. The Scrum developers are adamant that the Scrum Master should not be thought of as a project manager. Others, however, may not always find it easy to see the difference. |
| Sprint  | A development iteration. Sprints are usually 2-4 weeks long. |
| Velocity | An estimate of how much product backlog effort that a team can cover in a single sprint. Understanding a team’s velocity helps them estimate what can be covered in a sprint and provides a basis for measuring improving performance. |
